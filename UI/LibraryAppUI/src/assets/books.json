    "description" : "<p><b>The harrowing true story of abduction and survival from the courageous young woman who lived it—now the subject of a Lifetime original movie, <i>I Am Elizabeth Smart.</i></b><br><b><i></i></b><br><b><i></i></b>In this memoir, Elizabeth Smart reveals how she survived and the secret to forging a new life in the wake of a brutal crime. On June 5, 2002, fourteen-year-old Elizabeth Smart, the daughter of a close-knit Mormon family, was taken from her home in the middle of the night by religious fanatic Brian David Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Barzee. Elizabeth was kept chained, dressed in disguise, repeatedly raped, and told she and her family would be killed if she tried to escape. After her rescue on March 12, 2003, she rejoined her family and worked to pick up the pieces of her life.</p><p>With <i>My Story, </i>Elizabeth tells of the constant fear she endured every hour, her courageous determination to maintain hope, and how she devised a plan to manipulate her captors and convinced them to return to Utah, where she was rescued minutes after arriving. Smart explains how her faith helped her stay sane in the midst of a nightmare and how she found the strength to confront her captors at their trial and see that justice was served.</p><p>In the years after her rescue, Smart transformed from victim to advocate, traveling the country and working to educate, inspire and foster change. She has created a foundation to help prevent crimes against children and is a frequent public speaker. She and her husband, Matthew Gilmour, now have two children.</p>",

    "description" : "This is a biographical novel on Shivaji Maharaj. This historical novel has created history in the world of literature and books. Shivaji Maharaj is the most worshipped person in Maharashtra. Every single household here knows Shivaji. He is the most respected and worshipped character. He was a dream come true. Shivaji was born as a Hindu but at such time when Hinduism was forgotten by the Hindus. In his novel Ranjit Desai - pictures Shivaji from his birth rather he starts with the days prior to his birth. Before writing this novel Desai has searched history, he has not left any stone unturned while doing so. Writing on Shivaji was a very difficult task. Shivaji had many qualities and the last 3-4 centuries have changed people`s view about him. They have become more possessive about him adding unnecessarily, and untruthfully to his qualities - considering him a god. On this background it was very difficult to portray Shivaji as perfect as possible Desai had realised his responsiblity. He has pictured Shivaji metaculously in this novel. Religious but not superstitious, strict but not wicked, adventurous but not impetuous, practical but not aimless, realistic, visionary but not dreamy. Graceful but not prodigal. Desai has succeeded in highlighting Shivaji`s human nature. His base was that of a human. He valued all, respected every religion. He was an expert commander. He awakened the love for motherland in the sleeping mind, of people. He ignited their confidence. While describing this, Desai has brought many of Shivaji`s qualities into limelight. Shivaji was a noble king but he was a nobleman. He also had his own suffereings. He lost many, but his first preference was his motherland. As we go on reading we get involved in the book so much that we live each moment and when Desai ends the novel we feel that &amp;quot;WE` have lost Shivaji.<br>",

Try as he may, he cannot deny his attraction to this woman with fine eyes, a playful spirit, a mind of her own… and an embarrassing family that is frankly, and utterly, beneath him. But it is Elizabeth who controls both their destinies, and whose surprises will change Darcy’s life yet again.<p><p></p></p>",

    "description" : "<p>The Academy Award's Best Picture of the year is now the <i>New York Times</i>-bestselling, must-read novel of 2018.</p><p>\"[A] phenomenally enrapturing and reverberating work of art in its own right...[that] vividly illuminates the minds of the characters, greatly enhancing our understanding of their temperaments and predicaments and providing more expansive and involving story lines.\" —<i>Booklist</i></p><p>Visionary storyteller Guillermo del Toro and celebrated author Daniel Kraus combine their estimable talent in this haunting, heartbreaking love story.</p><p>It is 1962, and Elisa Esposito—mute her whole life, orphaned as a child—is struggling with her humdrum existence as a janitor working the graveyard shift at Baltimore’s Occam Aerospace Research Center. Were it not for Zelda, a protective coworker, and Giles, her loving neighbor, she doesn’t know how she’d make it through the day.</p><p>Then, one fateful night, she sees something she was never meant to see, the Center’s most sensitive asset ever: an amphibious man, captured in the Amazon, to be studied for Cold War advancements. The creature is terrifying but also magnificent, capable of language and of understanding emotions...and Elisa can’t keep away. Using sign language, the two learn to communicate. Soon, affection turns into love, and the creature becomes Elisa’s sole reason to live.</p><p>But outside forces are pressing in. Richard Strickland, the obsessed soldier who tracked the asset through the Amazon, wants nothing more than to dissect it before the Russians get a chance to steal it. Elisa has no choice but to risk everything to save her beloved. With the help of Zelda and Giles, Elisa hatches a plan to break out the creature. But Strickland is on to them. And the Russians are, indeed, coming.</p><p>Developed from the ground up as a bold two-tiered release—one story interpreted by two artists in the independent mediums of literature and film—<i>The Shape of Water </i>is unlike anything you’ve ever read or seen.</p><p>“Most movie novelizations do little more than write down what audiences see on the screen. But the novel that’s accompanying Guillermo del Toro’s new movie <i>The Shape of Water</i> is no mere adaptation. Co-author Daniel Kraus’ book and the film tell the same story, of a mute woman who falls in love with an imprisoned and equally mute creature, in two very different ways.” —io9</p><br><p>Praise for <i>The Shape of Water</i> directed by Guillermo del Toro</p><p>Winner of the 2018 Academy Award for Best Picture</p><p>Winner of the 2018 Academy Award for Best Director</p><p>Winner of the 2018 Academy Award for Music (Original Score)</p><p>Winner of the 2018 Academy Award for Production Design</p><p>Winner of the 2018 Golden Globe Award for Best Director of a Motion Picture</p><p>\"With encouragement from critics and awards voters, discerning viewers should make Fox Searchlight’s December release the season’s classiest date movie—for perhaps the greatest of <i>The Shape of Water</i>’s many surprises is how extravagantly romantic it is.” —<i>Variety</i></p><p>\"It is never less than magnificent.” —<i>TheDaily Beast</i></p><p>\"A visually and emotionally ravishing fantasy that should find a welcome embrace from audiences starved for imaginative escape.” —<i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></p><p>Awarded the Golden Lion for Best Film at the74th Annual Venice International Film Festival</p>",
